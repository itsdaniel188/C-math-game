# C-math-game
simple math game using C++<br>

With C++ you must do more hands on work to make sure the program runs the way you want it to. This is a simple arithmetic game. You input 4 different numbers of different types (Floating number, Whole number, etc.)

Those 4 numbers given will be manipulated with various arithmetic operations and the program will let you know wether you are right or wrong.

You must get all questions right to win the game at 100 points.

This is typically where you would get explained what every line does in the code, but I challenge you to read through my code and within 2 days manage to fully understand what is going on.

Use google, chatgpt and the internet to figure it out. This can be considered as "Reverse Engineering" and in the tech industry, a lot of times you will simply find yourself researching the answer to a problem as knowing everything is impossible.

The true skill is knowing what to look for and what questions to ask. Good luck.
